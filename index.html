        <p><h2>üìú About My Journey</h2></p>
        <p>
          I am currently looking for new challenges to put into practice my knowledge in design and management of projects and products. I have been developing webapp and mobileapp projects in different areas for seven years. I have experience in product design (UX and UI) that I currently put into practice at UADE in Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been managing projects and people for 5 years. I have worked during that time in different areas: telecommunication, banking, health. I also dedicated part of those years (2 years) to SAP and K3A consulting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I have the Scrum Master certification and I was able to put it into practice in the Grupo Estisol.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tend to look for alternatives to solve problems in a more creative way, optimizing the time and resources available and I love to be constantly learning new things. I'm practicing illustration, UX/UI design, video editing and coding for 3D Animation and Modelling Websites to challenge myself and find a new job.
