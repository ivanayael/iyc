        <h2>📜 About Myself</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ivana Yael Currá. After more than 10 years of working as a Project Manager for over 20 companies, they decided not to hire me anymore.<br>
        So, I decided to make a career change.<br>
        I had the opportunity to contribute to the world of entertainment during 2021 and go on and partially see myself through the eyes of others and remember everything I lost in my memory about myself.<br>
        In 2023, I started my career as an actress. It didn’t go too well, to be honest, but now I see a world full of possibilities.<br>
        In 2024, I didn't give up acting and I re-started my learning at UNA, <br>
        I returned to practicing taekwondo ITF, started cooking near my home <br>
        I am still part of UADE as an adjunct teacher. In the Faculty of Design and Architecture, the director has decided not to give a space to continue teaching at UADE due to a performance rating of 52%/80%.<br>
        Without further support, I am uncertain about what will happen in 2025 at UADE.<br>
        However, in 2025, I am planning to study design and development in video games formally at Universidad de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires and 
        I finally going to start my brand officialy and 100% on rule online and I have plans to make it bigger, little by little.</p>

          <h3> ⚔️☂️ 2023 </h3>
          <p>
              It was the year that decided to make a new carrer path but I don't know where to start <br>
              I started my career as an actress at ISEC. I was a good time. I got struggle with the memory problem, but I managed to finish the year. <br>
              I got the chance to went to the last RTX and I didn't go. I regret it. A lot, because I want to see people there<br>
              I got alse the change to see the Emmys but I didn't went. I was afraid to be exposed to the public in that way. I didn't feel prepare to do that kind of jump specially struggling with my memorya in different city<br>
              My grandmother Lila, who pass away in december 2023, inspire me to keep going and not only going as a viewer, also got the chance to be there with all the rights and dream and work to be nominated.<br>
              I promise to myself and to my family to go to the next Emmys and RTX. <br>
          </p>
          <h3> 🥋🫂 2024 </h3>
            <p>
              I’ve become a better person. I’m still working on that. Sometimes, it’s hard to look through a window with a smile instead of a neutral or panicked expression.<br>
              I managed to finish some courses this year, though not at my best performance. I need to work on paying more attention in class, but it was better than 2023 and definitely better than 2022 and 2021, when I struggled with a memory problem.<br>
              I got promoted to half red belt in Taekwondo ITF. I can't believe I got that far. But I still need to work on stretching a lot. I didn’t perform the wood-breaking part with the right technique. <br>
              I used the half black belt technick, so I lost my chance to make it in a easy way<br>
              I took some courses at UADE, so I can still go there. <br>
              I started studying at UNA but didn’t pass the entrance exam. I have to retake it in February 2025. I do exercises every day, even if it's just for a minute, but I did something. <br>
              I had the chance to be a speaker again at the Meet and Net event, and I also created the website and the web app for the event <br>
              I had the opportunity to be in a music video and a movie as an extra, better than I imagined. And I got pay in the last one! <br>
              I got a part in a play of The Addams Family adapted in the city of La Plata. It was great, even though I don’t know how to dance and can’t sing the higher notes. <br>
              No one has called me again for another play.  <br>
              Better, because It was a long way travel and I had to expend a lot of money and time <br>
              About the conventions and Emmys: RTX didn't happend again due the Rooster Teeth problems, It closed the door on May 2024. <br>
              I got the magazine of Emmys for the first time but also got problems to pay de suscription due my economic problems<br>
              One of my dreams is to be nominated for an Emmy and an Oscar, and I’m working on it. <br>
              I was doubting a lot that I was able to make but I know that if I applied to myself everyday I will get the chance to be there in a way or another<br>
            
              <em>sometimes I don’t have motivation, self-esteem, the will to keep going, and, most importantly, self-love, and I’m still looking for it. Everyday I work for that<br>
              I'm working on stuff to be better, feel better and do interesting things around<br>
              </em>
