        <p><h2>📜 About Myself</h2></p>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ivana Yael Currá. After more than 10 years of working as a Project Manager for over 20 companies, they decided not to hire me anymore.</p>
        
        <p>So, I decided to make a career change.</p>
        
        <p>I had the opportunity to contribute to the world of entertainment and partially see myself through the eyes of others.</p>
        
        <p>In 2023, I started my career as an actress. It didn’t go too well, to be honest, but now I see a world full of possibilities.</p>
        
        <p>I returned to practicing taekwondo, started cooking near my home, and I am planning to study design and development in video games.</p>
        
        <p>I am still part of UADE as an adjunct teacher. In the Faculty of Design and Architecture, the director has decided not to give a space to continue teaching at UADE due to a performance rating of 52%/80%. Without further support, I am uncertain about what will happen in 2025.</p>
        
        <p>However, I am finally going to start teaching online for real this time.</p>

        <p><h2>🏆 Personal Development and Achivements</h2></p>
        <p><h3>2023</h3></p>
        <p>I’ve become a better person. I’m still working on that. Sometimes, it’s hard to look through a window with a smile instead of a neutral or panicked expression.</p>

        <p>I managed to finish some courses this year, though not at my best performance. I need to work on paying more attention in class, but it was better than 2022 and definitely better than 2021 and 2020, when I struggled with a memory problem.</p>
        
        <p>I got promoted to half red belt in Taekwondo. I can't believe I got that far. But I still need to work on stretching a lot. I didn’t perform the wood-breaking part with the right technique.</p>
        
        <p>I took some courses at UADE, so I can still go there, but it wasn’t my best self.</p>
        
        <p>I started studying at UNA but didn’t pass the entrance exam. I have to retake it in February 2025. I do exercises every day, even if it's just for a minute, but I did something.</p>
        
        <p>I had the chance to be a speaker again at the Meet and Net event, and I also created the website and the web app for the "sorteo."</p>
        
        <p>I had the opportunity to be in a music video and a movie as an extra, better than I imagined.</p>
        
        <p>I got a part in a play of The Addams Family adapted in the city of La Plata. It was great, even though I don’t know how to dance and can’t sing the higher notes. No one has called me again for another play.</p>
        
        <p>I still don’t have motivation, self-esteem, the will to keep going, and, most importantly, self-love, and I’m still looking for it.</p>
        
        <p>I hope one day I’ll find the answer.</p>

    <p><h2>Studying</h2></p>
    <p>I started my Acting studies at UNA in Argentina in April 2024, after dropping out of ISEC in 2023. It was the first time I dropped out of a career or a course. It was a good decision. One of the best I ever made. It is really hard but I attacking my main problems with fire...Like a counter attack but better. I recommend study there so much!</p>
