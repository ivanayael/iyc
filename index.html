        <p><h2>üìú About Myself </h2></p>
        <p>Hi. I'm Ivana Yael Curr√°. After more that 10 years of working as a Project Manager for more than 20 companies, the companies itself decided that they do not want to hire me anymore</p>

        <p>So I decide to make a Carrear change path</p>
    
        <p>I got the opportunity to change the world for good in enterteiment and see myself partially in the view of others</p>
    
        <p>During 2023, I started my carrear as a actress, not too well, being honest, but right know I see a world full of possibilities</p>

        <p>I came back to taekwondo, I started cooking near my home, I am going to study design and development in videogames</p>

        <p>I still part of the UADE as an adjunt teacher. In the faculty of Design and Arquitecture the Director does not want to teach inside UADE anymore because of 52%/80% percent of performance and noone else is supporting me so I do not know what is going to happend in 2025</p>

        <p>But I going to start teaching online by real this time</p>

        <p><h2>üèÜ Personal Development and Achivements</h2></p>
        <p><h3>2023</h3></p>
        <p> I become a better person. I still working on that. Sometimes, It is hard to see a windows with a smile and not with a neutral or panic face.</p>
		    <p> I got to finish some courses this year, not in my best performace. I need to work on pay more attention in class, but it was better than 2022 and definetly better thatn 2021 and 2020, with a high-memory problem</p>
		    <p> I got promoted to half red belt in Taekwondo. I can belive I get that far. But I need to work on streaching a lot. I did not make the wood-break part with the right technick</p>
        <p> I got to some courses in UADE so I can still go there, but it was not my best self</p>
        <p> I started studied in UNA but I did not pass the entrance period. I have to do it again in february 2025. I do exercies all days, even just a minutes but I made something</p>
        <p> I got the chance to be a speaker again in an event Meet and Net and I made also the website and the webapp for the "sorteo"</p>
        <p> I got the change to be on a music video and in a movie as an extra, better than I imagine</p>
        <p> I get the part in an Assemble in a play of The Addams Family adapted in the city of La Plata. It was great, even if I do not know how to dance and I can not sing the highers notes. Nobody else call me again for another play</p>
      
        <p>I still not have motivation, self-autosteam, will to keep living and most important, self love and I still looking for it</p>
        <p>I hope one day I could have the answer</p>
